Within a window of 1000, we have more than 60% of base pairs


Aggregate the human RNA together, Agggregate the flu genes together

Give a sequence, 
Break it into k-mers

each organism has a preference for bases, dinuclleotides
The larger k-mers are more specific 
Compare distribution with known organisms

How close can you get
The sequence created by the k-mer

1/4^(size of overlap)

Expect to find some that are reverse complimentary
Number of reverse  matching k-mers, correlates to energy

Reduce the chance for strong locla bonds

Given a sequence of rna, count the k-mers, how many k-mers have matching reverse
This score can be computed

Figure out if the swap is desirable

RNA sequence s
Map each different amino acid
Amino acid apears at position 27, 33, 81
Loop (n times){
Select random amino acid)
Select two random positions for that amino acid
If codon at position 1 is different than 2
Attempt swap
Figure the average probablity of binding.
Use linear fold algorithm probability of each base
If it increases the average, swap it
}
Every x/n times, fold it
